# Instructor: Activity: git History

- This is written to be synchronous
- This can be done in-person or online, using breakout rooms
  - In Part 2, the group must be able to look at a shared set of info... This will require students to share their screens or somethng.
- Ideally, small groups are 4-5 people.
  - Activity doesn't support 7+ groups

---

- The point is to get them to visually play around and work with commits
- See the movement of commits
- Get them to talk about Git commands out loud

---

- Don't let students spend all of their time on Part 1
